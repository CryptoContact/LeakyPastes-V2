A TreeMap is a self-balancing binary search tree. In modern languages, this is normally implemented as a Red-black tree.

TreeMap comes in handy when you need:
1. fast random access by key
2. maintaining order of the key, as well as
3. updating the key order quickly

If the requirements are only 1) and 2), we can get away with a hashmap and a list/array and that's exactly what most interview problems ask.

Python does not have a built-in TreeMap data structure as found in some other languages like Java. However, you can achieve similar functionality using the sortedcontainers module, specifically the SortedDict class. This module provides efficient implementations of sorted collections, including sorted dictionaries which can function similarly to a TreeMap.

The simplest possible example of recursion in Python is the calculation of the factorial of a number.

This simple example demonstrates the basic concept of recursion: a function calling itself to solve a smaller instance of the same problem, with a base case to terminate the recursion.
